1. move the application and the system folder outside the public:: for security reasons
2. seperate the production and development environment in the public/index.php file
3. create the .htacess file
4. copy application/database.php in 2 new folders development and production folder and provide different database info
5. create a config file cms_config.php
6. add cms_config and database(libraries) in the autoload.php file
7. create a MY_Controller(in core folder) that extends CI_Controller, and Frontend_Controller and Admin_Controller that extends MY_Controller( in libraries folder)
8. since the Frontend_Controller and Admin_Controller are in different folder there will be an error so to fix the problem create an autoload function in config.php file with following code snippit
<snippit>
function __autoload($classname){
  if(strpos($classname,'CI_')!== 0){
    $file = APPPATH . "libraries/". $classname .".php";
    if(file_exists($file) and is_file($file)){
      include_once($file);
    }
  }
}

</snippit>

9. create a migrations folder in application
10.create a migration.php file in the controller/admin
11. create 001_Class_name.php file to create the migration files that create the tables in the database
